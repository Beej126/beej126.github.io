This is THE real wave of the futureâ€¦ Finally, weâ€™ll get to leave the whole stupid bulb replacement game behind!&#160; LED light source has lifespan specs of 20,000 hours!&#160; LEDâ€™s are the low temp light source we all love in those nifty new flash lights these days.&#160; Contrast specs will also be a thing of the past, theyâ€™re rating this model at 100,000:1!!&#160; Looks like theyâ€™re still working on getting the light level output up to snuff, this was only rated at a very anemic 800 lumensâ€¦ iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s only a matter of time as well. Vivitekâ€™s already got a 1080p model outâ€¦ and itâ€™s only $14k! ðŸ™‚ [Endgadget.comâ€™s coverage][1] [ProctorCentral.comâ€™s coverage][2] [<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/_XlySlDLkdOc/ShVUJw9aiVI/AAAAAAAADQ0/SON-JwOPPeQ/image_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="183" height="135" />][3] Starts to make sense why weâ€™re seeing this technology pop up in the pico projector end of the spectrum at firstâ€¦ low res, low brightness, low power, low footprint all combine for a synergistic package at the moment. [<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/_XlySlDLkdOc/ShVUKSjpieI/AAAAAAAADQ4/sYj3nt-LYds/image%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="235" />][4] I just bought a bulb technology projector (LCD based Epson Home Cinema 720)â€¦ hopefully by the time my bulb is burning out (3 years??) LED projectors will be down to mainstream prices.
