This is the Canon MP830 that I got two years ago for ~$200:

As of 07 Oct 2009 itâ€™s now the MX860 thatâ€™s sitting in that slotâ€¦ progress marches on ðŸ™‚

As with all this consumer electronics cr_p thereâ€™s no guarantees itâ€™ll be all sunshine and daisiesâ€¦The initial unit I received had some serious problems that can now confidently chalk up to a solid lemon syndromeâ€¦ I returned it and the _brand new_ replacement I got back has had absolutely zero issues and is still cranking like a champ as of Q4 2009! This model prints very decent photosâ€¦ not tippy top commercial quality but pretty darn good on glossy paper. Paper seems to matter as much as ink... I've seen fading on some glossy stock hanging on the wall next to other stock that hasn't. &#160; <a href="/2009_10_01_archive.html" target="_blank">Make sure to checkout my Continuous Ink Supply System write up</a>
