I‚Äôm drafting off the idea of expanding geeky punctuation into words (popularized by [www.SlashDot.org][1])   
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot" target="_blank">Funny story behind his originating motivation</a>)   
so SlashDot equals /. 

Based on that, being a comment happy developer, I thought an expansion of /* would be particularly apropos as that‚Äôs the well known opening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)" target="_blank">comment syntax</a> in languages like C, C++, C#, Java, T-SQL, etc. 

Of course, SlashStar.com and readily desirable derivates were already taken üôÅ ‚Ä¶ however, browsing for slash synonyms turned up "<a href="https://dictionary.reference.com/browse/virgule" target="_blank">virgule</a>", specifically for the <u>forward</u> slash character, nice!... yeah ok, it doesn't role off the tongue but its obscurity meant I had an available domain name hit and that‚Äôs obviously key! üôÇ 

And thus www.VirguleStar.com was born.
