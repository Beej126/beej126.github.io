I’ve watched episodes 1-4 so far… 4 is a pretty good one
  
Simply starting at the beginning seems good too
  
Make sure you take advantage of the preconfigured playlists &#8212; look for “(play all)” &#8212; so they queue up and you can watch them straight through w/o having to continually find the next one &#8212; which really takes away from the enjoyment after a while
  
Search for “james burke episode xxx” to dial in on each bundle if you’re not seeing it from the URL I gave above… there appear to be at least up to 20 episodes
  
(btw: My buddy Joel turned me on to it… he’s full of nifty idears… here’s a gratuitous plug for his vlog site: [https://joelart.blip.tv/][2])
