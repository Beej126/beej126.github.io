Looking for small-group biking… want some bass to carry to other riders in the immediate vicinity over typical road & wind noise... needs to be well contained for bumping around and not too heavy since we hop a lot of trains, stairs, etc

# My experience
      
just gave them a test run tonight 22 Sep 2010
they bang pretty nice off the back bike rack
compared to the logitech 28mm i had before (eBay = $30, no longer available), they are better enough to be worth $150 to me
iPhone compatible
feel solid, not as bulky as i expected
Battery = NiMH 180AAHC3TMX 3.6V 1800mAh (see photo)

## Batteries!!

I'm gaga over the [high beam LEDs that run on 18650 Li-Ion rechargables as my main bike headlamp](/2010/09/cree-led-based-bicycle-lights-and.html)... so I hacked together 2 cells in parallel ... 18650 is too long to fit the existing battery cavity so i just strapped my makeshift box on the outside... i was in too much of a hurry and the whole thing is glitchy under road conditions but it <span class="hl">definitely proved the theory that a 3.7v supply is fine</span>.

We couldn't resist cracking it open to check the juice and sure enough it was 3 x 18650's =)
