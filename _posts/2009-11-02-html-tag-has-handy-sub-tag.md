(again, who knew?!) 

  * Found it here under “<a href="https://puzzling.org/computing/help/html/inline" target="_blank">Photo Albums that Wrap</a>”.
  * Coupled with the “display: inline” style on the table…
  * it winds up being the perfect answer for showing nicely wrapped <a href="/2009/11/good-movies.html" target="_blank">DVD covers</a> (basically the same as a photo album).
  * Don’t miss the Align attribute to place it either above or below the table.
  * I’m sure this will come in handy in many places requiring a well contained but still wrappable block.
