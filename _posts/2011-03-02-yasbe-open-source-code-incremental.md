The reason I started this little project is none of the premier backup packages currently support Blu_ray‚Ä¶ I know that sounds amazing but [check out the help forums for stuff like Acronis][1] and Paragon and Yosemite‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a pretty picture out there currently with regards to Blu_ray‚Ä¶ and of course, I had already bought my BD drive before I started to realize how dismal this all was‚Ä¶ so I was inclined to find a solution üôÇ

I‚Äôll admit right up front, the UI is a a bit cluttered and terse‚Ä¶ classic, good_enough_for_own_purposes_in_the_time_i*had syndrome

[![image][2]][3]

  * <strike><a href="https://code.google.com/p/yasbe/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FApp%253Fstate%253Dclosed" target="_blank">full source svn repo</a></strike> Update 3/24/15 * Google is shutting down code.google.com üôÅ but provided easy migration to github: [New source link][4].
  * Basically, it just works like a champ‚Ä¶ I really like how it came together‚Ä¶ WPF is awesome‚Ä¶ it all feels _very_ peppy & responsive on my ‚Äúaging‚Äù Quad Core 2‚Ä¶
  * currently implemented on sql server 2008 (express)‚Ä¶ should be relatively database agnostic in theory, but‚Ä¶
  * The one big sql server 2008 dependency that I do use is _[SQL Server table*valued stored proc parameters][5]._
  * install the default database structure via [.BAK file][6]
  * This SQL Server table proc parm approach is a particularly fun optimization I‚Äôve been itching to implement to see how it hangs together in lieu of using it elsewhere (whenever I can finally get my work to upgrade to SQL Server 2008!!! üôÇ
  * Anyway, as far as the actual application goes, see screenshot, it‚Äôs WPF 4 code with a lot of little tricks I‚Äôve learned along the way with my other much larger scope [WPF LOB project at work][7].
  * YASBE (‚ÄúYet Another Simple Backup Enabler‚Äù) immediately presents the typical checkboxed include/exclude filesystem tree where you select which folders are in and out‚Ä¶ you can of course simply select a root drive letter if you‚Äôre organized to have everything you care about on one big data drive.
  * I underestimated the complexity of rolling my own folders treeview but [I like the work I achieved in the .Net IO FileSystem code][8] & [the corresponding WPF TreeView XAML here][9] (search for ‚ÄúTreeView‚Äù)‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen other examples of loading a WPF TreeView (telerik knowledge base etc)‚Ä¶ but I feel like i did mine a little tighter‚Ä¶ easier to copy/understand I think‚Ä¶ the tree is efficiently _lazy loading_‚Ä¶ ie it only scans the next set of folders down when you expand a parent
  * Then one would typically hit the ‚ÄúSelect Next Disc's Worth Of Files‚Äù button and YASBE cranks down the list until it‚Äôs included 25GB worth of new/changed files that are candidates for going to a Blu*ray disk.
  * the .Net DirectoryInfo.GetFiles() appears to be adequately performant on my average desktop hardware ‚Ä¶ it scans my 200GB+ of photos and other important documents in <u><16 seconds</u>‚Ä¶ actually it scans all those files, ‚ÄìAND\* uploads it to sql server (via table stored proc parameter) and does the comparison to all the previously recorded date stamps to determine what is new/changed‚Ä¶ ‚ÄìAND\* sends that recordset back to the client and displays it on a datagrid, all that in 16 seconds‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm absolutely pleased with that‚Ä¶ I feel that the master blast of all those file records up to SQL Server using the table valued stored proc parm really nicely optimizes that step.
  * Then one would hit ‚Äúcopy to staging folder‚Äù‚Ä¶ wait quite a bit longer to copy 25 GB to your Blu*ray‚Äôs staging folder (actually it‚Äôs effectively more around 23GB max from what I‚Äôve read)
  * Then I highly recommend you burn your Blu*ray by drag/dropping your burn staging folder into Nero BurnLite ([which is free][10])
  * Nero BurnLite has been 100% reliable for me and it‚Äôs a perfectly bare bones data disc burning software, exactly what I want, without any other fluff.
  * I had _major_ reliability problems with Windows 7's built*in disc burning facility!!!‚Ä¶ I coastered 5 out of 6 tries before I bailed and went to Nero‚Ä¶ it becomes mentally painful trial and error at 25GB a pop for a cheap arse like me :)‚Ä¶ Yet Win7 seems absolutely fine for DVD/CD burning‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve burned those successfully w/o a glitch.
  * Here‚Äôs the interesting anecdotal evidence, after the burn, Nero spews out a list of mandatory renames for files that somehow wouldn‚Äôt fit the disc‚Äôs file system‚Ä¶ which is UDF I believe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm wondering if Win7 doesn‚Äôt perform that kind of necessary bulletproofing and that‚Äôs why the burns would always fail several minutes in, after wildly jumping around between random %complete estimates and a schizophrenic progress bar.
  * Nero methodically clicks off percent*completes nice & fast ‚Ä¶ seems like 25GB only takes about 15mins‚Ä¶ very doable‚Ä¶ I did 8 x 25GB discs to cover my whole photo library while working on other things and it went by like clockwork.
