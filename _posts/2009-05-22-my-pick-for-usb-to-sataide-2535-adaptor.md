Highlights:

  * <a href="https://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2329300&sku=M501-1220" target="_blank">Sabrent Brand, Model: USB-DSC5</a> &#8211; $20
  * 2A Power Supply.&#160; I read that at least one other brand, KingWin maybe, only had a 100mA! feed‚Ä¶ and that guy was finding that it wasn‚Äôt enough juice for a 3.5‚Äùer
  * All the cables/adapters you need‚Ä¶ SATA power, SATA Data, gee wonder what that real small one 2nd from the left is for??
  * Normal 3 prong PC style power cable‚Ä¶ other brands had the fairly standard 2 prong laptop cable which you might find preferable‚Ä¶ I live in Germany and it‚Äôs easier for me to find the German style wall plug with the 3 prong cables.

As an aside, I‚Äôm swinging back to TigerDirect rather than NewEgg for a while‚Ä¶ Tiger really screwed some things up for me at their local stores in Chicago so i was carrying a grudge‚Ä¶ but i tend to think their mailorder business has always been decent‚Ä¶ NewEgg really jacks you on the APO shipping‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm such a fickle filly. (NewEgg does tend to have better product images though, so this links to Tiger but image was pulled from NewEgg üôÇ <a title="Tiger" href="https://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2329300&sku=M501-1220" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/_XlySlDLkdOc/ShZh6WC2ghI/AAAAAAAADQ8/Bjis50QdSsU/image%5B12%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="368" height="280" /></a> This ‚ÄúNewer Technology‚Äù model looks a little ‚Äúslicker‚Äù but is it really worth $10 more?
