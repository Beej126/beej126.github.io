  * .Net Framework v4 New Features 
      * Parallel Linq Extensions 
  * C# 4.0 New Features (_all good stuff IMPO, variance being the hardest to grok_) 
      * Named and Optional Parameters – already use this quite a bit 
      * Dynamic Support – handy way to ignore the complexity of ‘dynamically’ generated type declarations (e.g. linq results & COM Interop) 
      * Co/Contra-Variance – primarily intended to make .Net Framework methods with Generic type parameters like IEnumerable<T> “_work like we’d expect_” as is often quoted in explanatory texts (look for Jon Skeet and Eric Lippert).&#160; It removes a couple rather unexpected annoyances that C# 3 would’ve snagged on.
      * Covariance represents “upcastable”.&#160; Concerns types coming out of an API.&#160; Represented by “out” keyword, e.g. public interface IEnumerable<out T>
      * Contravariance is “downcastable”. Typically concerns types passed into an API.&#160; e.g. public interface IComparer<in T>
      * Invariance is when something must go both in and out of a method and it can’t be declared differently on either side of the interface, it must be the same coming and going.
    
      * COM Interop
