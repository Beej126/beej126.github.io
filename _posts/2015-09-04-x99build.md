**Mobo**: [Gigabyte GA-X99-UD4][7] &#8211; LGA 2011-v3

**CPU**: Intel i7-5820k &#8211; 6 core Haswell-E

**Cooler**: Corsair H80i GT

**PSU**: [Corsair HX750i][8]

**RAM**:&nbsp;Crucial 32GB (4 x 8GB) Ballistix Sport (DDR4 PC4-19200&nbsp;2400 MHz, 16-16-16 CAS)

**Case**:&nbsp;[Cooler Master Storm Scout 2 Advanced][9] &#8211; love that&nbsp;rubber&nbsp;top handle! ðŸ™‚

**SSD**:&nbsp;SAMSUNG 850 EVO 500GB

**Video**: [Asus Strix Nvidia GeForce GTX 750Ti 2GB][10] ... this card is a perfect fit in my book:

  * No drivers necessary to [vanilla boot into Yosemite][11] &#8211; no QE/CI out of box but very workable for initial install and then full QE/CI via Nvidia "webdriver".
  * fanless unless pushed hard
  * 3 x digital display, INCLUDING DP &#8211; I can confirm this card supports at least dual monitors under Yosemite via any combination of DP / HDMI / DVI (dual- link) with any of them driving 2560 x 1600 res... I've seen mention of possible 4k support on this card and can't wait to confirm that myself ðŸ™‚
  * no more horsepower than I care to pay for => $160 at the time ... and was well stocked in major outlets circa March 2015

[PC Hound build pricing][12]
  
($1,675.26 pre-tax from Amazon on 2015-03-11)

## [See Hackintosh Install][11]

Biggest gripe &#8211; <span class="hl">the Corsair USB software is total junk</span>... It sounds cool to be able to monitor temps but it is so bad I would seriously recommend against it... I traced OS X re-wake back to the H80i cooler and the drivers are all super flaky under windows... reports of all kinds of known issues installing on Win8 and above out there on the interwebs... even with the well known hacks in place, only some rare reboots would yield working gauges for me... looks like USB device initialization timing bugs... sounds neat at face value but the unreliable drivers ruin the whole experience... there are open source alternatives brewing... guess there's a new build up for Win10, we'll see how that goes.

2015-09-03 Update: Spooky! Machine was just totally dead this morning, no power up at all ... jiggled the usual stuff, manually shunted the mobo power-on pins, re-seated ram, nothing... was expecting dead PSU but it checked out fine on voltmeter... and test button on PSU revved up the fans just fine... so next i started figuring dead mobo and was basically giving up ... then the big guy nudged a thought into my sad mind, "try the paperclip trick"... so i shunted pins 15 & 16 on the back of the 24pin header (while PSU connected to mobo) and sure enough it all powered right up <whew>... after that the case power button was working normally again as well... no other changes...

very interesting behavior ... really grasping to place blame anywhere particular &nbsp;???

i shudder to think of the time and effort i could have easily wasted swapping out working components chasing this ghost

we did have a power outage here a couple days ago but the machine had been running fine since then; even going in and out of sleep mode so it's hard to think there would be something "lingering"... yet there i was
