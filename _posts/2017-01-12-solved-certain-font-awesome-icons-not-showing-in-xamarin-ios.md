### Problem

None of the icons in the FA v4.7 release were showing up for me, while all the others were... so I had a basic working scenario but not entirely.

### Background

  * I was doing a simple approach of showing the icons in a Label like so:
  
    `<Label FontFamily="FontAwesome" Text="&#xf2b5;" />`
  * I had my FontAwesome.ttf file under the iOS project's Resources folder and via a [font explorer tool][1] I confirmed that the v4.7 icons were indeed present in that file 
      * for the record, the new v4.7 icons look to begin at unicode hex xf2b5 ("handshake-o")
      * I also had my own FontAwesome.ttf listed under my `Info.plist > UIAppFonts` along with another custom font I was using successfully
  * From previous approach, I also had the [Iconize][2] library loaded... with it's "iconize-fontawesome.ttf" listed in Info.plist as well

`broken Info.plist (excerpt)`
```
  
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
  
<array>
    
<string>iconize-fontawesome.ttf</string>
    
<string>iconize-material.ttf</string>
    
<string>RichardsonBrandAccelerator.ttf</string>
    
<string>FontAwesome.ttf</string>
  
</array>
  
```

### Solution

The clue that tipped me off was that i noticed Iconize was built with an older version of FontAwesome... so as a guess, I re-ordered my FontAwesome.ttf entry ABOVE the iconize-fontawesome.ttf like below... and wouldn't you know it, that actually did the trick! : )

`WORKING Info.plist (excerpt)`
```
  
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
  
<array>
    
<string>RichardsonBrandAccelerator.ttf</string>
    
<string>FontAwesome.ttf</string>
    
<string>iconize-fontawesome.ttf</string>
    
<string>iconize-material.ttf</string>
  
</array>
  
```
