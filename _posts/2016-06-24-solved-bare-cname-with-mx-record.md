just thought i'd throw this out into the interwebz since it seems to be such a well known _no-can-do_ that is actually a very handy can-do (where applicable)...

## Background

DNS admin warnings advise against doing a "bare" (no prefix) CNAME along with an MX record, [example][1]
  
![][2]

## Disclaimer

What i'm successfully demonstrating here is <span class="hl">clearly non-standard according to the specs</span>...
  
however, i've proven it does work for SOME servers implementation of the standards (including major provider Office 365 on the MX side) so it's worth trying with your servers if this provides a convenient solution for your needs... and it will be immediately verifiably working or not; no "sometimes" ambiguity to worry about.

## Solution

Very simple &#8211; just try <span class="hl">positioning the MX record <strong>ABOVE</strong> the CNAME in the record order</span>, e.g.
  
![][3]

along with a happy O365 MX record (sorry i can't slam dunk it with showing actual host names, you'll have to trust me that it really did work and i didn't make this up)
  
![][4]

I've found this "[MX ToolBox][5]" to be loads of help for double checking the various DNS responses:
