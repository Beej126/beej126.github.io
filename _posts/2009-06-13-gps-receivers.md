#### Garmin GPS Models

<a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=157" target="_blank">Here’s the main page for the receiver only products</a> (so called “OEM”) 10x (BlueTooth) &#8211; this is the one Andrew and I have 

  * I finally got it to work well with my WinXP BlueTooth stack by turning off “AUTO CONNECT” checkbox buried under the BlueTooth virtual serial port properties 
  * Andrew has always said it works well with his HP WinCE based hand held 
  * Runs on a rechargeable battery so you do have to tether it (with included USB cable) every once in a while to recharge 
  * Garmin also included the cigarette lighter power adapter in my package… Pretty sure I wound up with two of these due to a screwed up initial shipment so I have a spare in case you don’t wind up with one… cigarette lighter to mini-usb is kindof a handy thingy to have in general these days… would charge other USB power based stuff like MP3 players etc. 
  * $107 retail 
  * <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=158&pID=423" target="_blank"><img title="Click here to view larger image" border="0" alt="Garmin GPS 10x Receiver for mobile devices" src="https://www.locationstore.com/images/Product/medium/28519.jpg" width="121" height="121" /></a> 
  * The annoying thing is I managed to find an actual Garmin.com link where it was posted as $50… BUT I DIDN’T SAVE THE DANG LINK <ARG!> 
  * <a href="https://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&q=%2B%22gps+10x%22&cid=18374702854470042297&scoring=p#ps-sellers" target="_blank">Cheapest new street price I’ve seen is around $80 (from reputable vendors like TheNerds.net, etc)</a>
  * <a href="https://shop.ebay.com/items/__garmin-gps-10x?_trkparms=65%253A12%257C66%253A2%257C39%253A1%257C72%253A1205&_dmpt=GPS_Devices&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_sop=15&_sc=1 " target="_blank">eBay has a refurb for $50 at the moment</a>

**I still wonder if USB might be slightly easier to deal with** than waiting for BlueTooth to connect, especially if you’re primarily using in a static environment like a car and it avoids the rechargeable battery dance so here’s a couple of those… 20x (USB) 

  * $70 retail 
  * [ <img border="0" src="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/store/assets/images/products/010-00695-00/en/cf-md.jpg" width="116" height="116" />][1]
  * this seems to be the one Garmin “recommends” for their PC oriented mapping products 

18x (USB) 

  * $85 retail 
  * **says it’s magnetic to hold onto your dash or something** 
  * [<img border="0" src="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/store/assets/images/products/010-00321-31/en/cf-lg.jpg" width="120" height="120" />][2] 

#### Mapping Software

  * [There’s a handy bundle with City Navigator North America NT and either the 20x for $150 or 10x for $100 which is a good bargain][3].
  * MobilePC is the more fancy faux 3d map interface that looks like most of the car GPS units UI’s everybody has these days 
  * nRoute is the flat 2d birds eye view map interface… it’s not as slick but it shows more map detail because less space is wasted on looking fancy 
  * I can show you where to get the software & maps for “very cheap” ;) 
  * [Gamin software update downloads][4]

#### 

#### Maps

  * The main thing to get for the <u>car</u> is “[City Navigator North America NT][5]” (retail $100)… looks like there’s already a 2010 version out
  * Garmin of course has all kinds of [trail/topo maps][6] too
