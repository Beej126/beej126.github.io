  * First one was a dud out of the box. Just didn‚Äôt cool at all. EdgeStar support said it was missing coolant. Took them about 2 full weeks to turn around the replacement. They paid all replacement shipping via printed return label. It was a new serial number, not a repair of my old one, and it looked new. 
* I am very satisfied now with this second unit and would definitely recommend it. 
* The look is very nice. The glass is great. The blue light is great. 
* The size is great, very deep. Fit my under-the-bar-cabinet-slot really well. A little shorter than the broken down old ‚ÄúScotsman‚Äù that was in there but nothing a couple 2x4‚Äôs didn‚Äôt fix. 
* Sure am glad to have found something in a more reasonable price range‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure the Scotsman stuff must last forever but at upwards of $2k, not on my kids‚Äô college budget üôÇ
* Cooling has been spot on for the 2 months I‚Äôve had it so far &lt;knock wood&gt;.
* The cheapest I was able to find it was from <a href="https://www.idealwinecoolers.com/product/BBR900BL_Koldfront-80-Can-Black-Built-In-Locking-Beverage-Cooler" target="_blank">‚ÄúIdeal Wine Coolers‚Äù for $400</a>. Half retail and $100 less than Amazon.
