first, get [Chocolatety][1] if you don't already have... killer handy

    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
    

then make sure you have a .csx runner... either [ScriptCS][2] or [csi.exe][3] starting with Visual Studio 2015 update 3

    choco install ScriptCS
    

setup the .csx to runner file association

    assoc .csx=CSharpScript
    ftype csharpscript=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\scriptcs.exe %1 -- %~2
    

_%~2 means all args starting with #2... see [ftype docs][4] for more_

_FYI for [TCC LE][5] folks, apparently i've stumbled into a rare backwards compatibility gap... TCC LE doesn't seem to support the %~2 syntax like cmd.exe and it escapes "%" differently, so substitute that portion of the ftype line above with "%%1 &#8212; %%2 %%3 %%4"_

lastly, edit your PATHEXT system environment variable to include .CSX which allows us to leave off the extension to launch our scripts just like native commands! =)

    setx PATHEXT %PATHEXT%;.CSX /M
    refreshenv.cmd
    

TCC LE requires OPTION > Startup > PathExt for the above to work

_refreshenv comes from Chocolately... it refreshes the current command line environment from registry, which we just updated via setx_

or runas admin > `C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables`
  
![image][6]

with all that fun stuff in place, we can finally do something nifty like this:

    C:\> myCSXScript arg1 arg2
    

## beautiful! =)
