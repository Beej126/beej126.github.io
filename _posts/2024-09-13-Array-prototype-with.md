Nice! javascript now has built in one liner for copy & update array item by index
[Array.with()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/with#browser_compatibility)

and a few other non-mutating companions like [toSpliced, toSorted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#copying_methods_and_mutating_methods)

sure, the array spread syntax already made it pretty easy but it's just cool to see super common patterns get this kind of TLC
